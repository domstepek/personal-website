            About Me
          </h1>
          <p className="columns-sm font-medium">
            I&apos;m a software engineer based in Sacramento, California. I&apos;m passionate about web development and I&apos;m always looking for opportunities to work on new and exciting technologies. I&apos;m currently working on a project called <a href='https://charla.cc/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer' className='text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-800'>Charla.cc</a> which is a platform to assist community owners and leaders in understanding and managing their communities that can range across many platforms like Slack, Discord, and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2020, I graduated from American River College with my <b>Associate of Science (A.S) in Computer Science</b>. Then, I transferred to California State University, Sacramento to pursue my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. After one semester, I dropped out of university and joined a coding bootcamp called <a href='https://www.hackreactor.com/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer' className='text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-800'>Hack Reactor</a> to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer where I went on to receive an <b>Advanced Software Engineering Certificate</b> upon completion.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have always been someone with many interests and hobbies. In terms of technology, my interests include <b>Web 3.0</b>, <b>VR/AR</b>, and <b>IoT</b>. In terms of everything else üòÅ, I enjoy going to music festivals üéµ, reading üìï, and traveling ‚úàÔ∏è.
